### Objective:
Utilizing the theory of contextual interference, this study sought to assess the impact of interleaved (non-blocked) training schedules on the learning of mass detection on mammograms and nodule detection on chest radiographs by radiology residents and a convolutional neural network (CNN).


### Overview
This repository contains the code required to reproduce the machine learning experiments reported in the main manuscript. Briefly, in this repository, we explore the impact of interleaved vs. blocked training schedules on the ability of a multi-task neural network to learn a radiology task. Ultimately, due to similarities between human and machine learning, the goal is to rapidly simulate curriculum changes for junior radiology residents, since investigations into optimal curriculums is currently severly limited by both participant recruitment and time.
