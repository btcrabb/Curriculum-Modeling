# Curriculum-Modeling
In this repository, we will explore the impact of interleaved vs. blocked training schedules on the ability of a multi-task neural network to learn a radiology task. If the neural networks demonstrate results consistent with human learners, it may be possible to simulate curriculum changes and human subject experimentation using machine learning.
